Recently the company's management is looking at the prospect of expanding the B2B sales and

To get you started you look at the following questions then later provide your insights in an effort
to answer the research question.<br />
● Which branch had the highest gross income?<br />
● Which branch was the top-rated?<br />
● Which branch was the lowest-rated?<br />
● Should the company spend more costs on advertising to normal clients or clients who
are members?<br />

payment methods?<br />
Remember: What matters the most is what your insights mean to the business. Make sure to
have a section where you elaborate on how your analysis findings tie to your recommendations.
